# ov_wav
OV_WAV - Wavelet analysis package for astronomical images, based on the À Trous transform

This package uses the wavelet transform À Trous, as a multicale method to analyze astronomical data with sources structured hierarchically, not assuming any predefined source brightness profile.

The code is written in IDL.

For instructions on use, please see USAGE.md.

This project was started in 2000 by Prof. Dr. Carlos Roberto Rabaça in the [Observatório do Valongo/UFRJ](http://www.ov.ufrj.br/en/) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil as astronomy undergraduate thesis of Daniel Nicolato Epitácio Pereira. [Cristiano da Rocha](https://github.com/crisdarocha) joined the group in 2001, contributing with part of the development in the use case of detection of intragroup light in groups of galaxies.

For details on the usage, please do not hesitate to contact me. I will do my best to reply to the questions.

In case of use of the project, we would appreciate a note and in scientific publications, the citation to the papers describing the method.
